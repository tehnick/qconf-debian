Description: nice configure script for qmake-based projects
 It is intended for developers who donâ€™t need (or want)
 to use the more complex GNU autotools. With qconf/qmake,
 it is easy to maintain a cross-platform project that
 uses a familiar configuration interface on *nix.
 .
 Qt 4.x and Qt 5.x are currently supported.
